\title{Conditional Distributions}
\usage{
slice_left(object, breakpoint, include = TRUE, ...)

slice_right(object, breakpoint, include = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Distribution to slice.}

\item{breakpoint}{Point at which to slice (single numeric).}

\item{include}{Logical; should the breakpoint be removed as well?
This is only realistically relevant if the
breakpoint has a non-zero probability of occurrence.}

\item{...}{Other arguments to pass to specific methods. Currently unused.}
}
\value{
A conditional distribution.
}
\description{
\code{slice_left()} removes probability to the left of some breakpoint,
conditioning the random variable to be bigger than the breakpoint.
\code{slice_right()} does the opposite: removes probability to the right,
conditioning to be smaller than the breakpoint.

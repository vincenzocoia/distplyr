#' Graft Distribution
#'
#' Replace a distribution's tail.
#' `graft_left()` takes a base distribution and grafts a distribution
#' to the left of some breakpoint; `graft_right()` grafts a distribution
#' to the right. The distribution being grafted is sliced at a breakpoint
#' and fit to the base distribution also at that breakpoint.
#' @param distribution Base distribution
#' @param graft The distribution being grafted.
#' @param breakpoint The location of the graft
#' @param include Logical; include the breakpoint in the base distribution?
#' @return Graft distribution object, which is a special type of mixture
#' distribution.

You're able to make a wide range of probability distributions using distplyr's manipulation functions, but you'll need to start with more standard, basic distributions first. There are typically three use cases for building a basic distribution:

1. Parametric families
2. Empirical distributions
3. Manually specified distributions

## 1\. Parametric Families

These include distributions like Normal, Exponential, Poisson, etc.

distplyr includes distributions present in base R's `r*`/`p*`/`d*`/`q*` selection of distributions. For example, a Normal distribution in base R has associated functions `rnorm()` etc. In distplyr:

```{r}
dst_norm(0, 1)
```

distplyr also includes other common distributions not present in base R, such as a generalized Pareto distribution:

```{r}
dst_gpd(0, 1, 1)
```

**November 2020**: Until this package gains some stability in its structure, there will be a limited number of these distributions -- but there will be plenty available in the not-too-distant future. 

## 2\. Empirical Distributions

Whereas base R only has the `ecdf()` function to handle empirical distributions, distplyr provides full functionality with `dst_empirical()`. Empirical distribution of `hp` values in the `mtcars` dataset:

```{r}
(hp <- dst_empirical(hp, data = mtcars))
```

The "step" in the name comes from the cdf:

```{r, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3}
plot(hp, "cdf", n = 501)
```

You can also weigh the outcomes differently. This is useful for explicitly specifying a probability mass function, as well as for other applications such as using kernel smoothing to find a conditional distribution. Here is an estimate of the conditional distribution of `hp` given `disp = 150`, with cdf depicted as the dashed line compared o the marginal with the solid line:

```{r}
K <- function(x) dnorm(x, sd = 25)
hp2 <- dst_empirical(hp, data = mtcars, weights = K(disp - 150))
plot(hp, "cdf", n = 1001)
plot(hp2, "cdf", n = 1001, lty = 2, add = TRUE)
```

The weighting provides us with a far more informative prediction of `hp` when `disp = 150` compared to the loess, which just gives us the mean:

```{r}
mean(hp2)
```

With a distribution, you can get much more, such as this 90% prediction interval:

```{r}
eval_quantile(hp2, at = c(0.05, 0.95))
```

Here's the proportion of variance that's reduced compared to the marginal:

```{r}
1 - variance(hp2) / variance(hp)
```

## 3\. Manually specified distributions

It's common to specify a distribution by explicitly specifying a representation, like a density, cdf, etc.

To do this, start with an empty distribution by calling `distribution()`, and then `set_` the representation of interest. Here's the random variable with cdf given by the `sqrt()` function:

```{r, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3}
(manual <- distribution() %>% 
  set_cdf(sqrt))
plot(manual, "cdf", from = 0, to = 1)
```

Down the road, you'll also be able to use purrr-style functions:

```
distribution() %>% 
    set_cdf(~ sqrt(.x))
```
